    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>French fries (North American English), chips (British English), finger chips (Indian English), french-fried
        potatoes, or simply fries, are batonnet or allumette-cut deep-fried potatoes of disputed origin from Belgium and
        France. They are prepared by cutting potatoes into even strips, drying them, and frying them, usually in a deep
        fryer. Pre-cut, blanched, and frozen russet potatoes are widely used, and sometimes baked in a regular or
        convection oven; air fryers are small convection ovens marketed for frying potatoes. </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>large russet potato, cut into evenly sized strips</li>
        <li>cups vegetable oil for frying, or as needed</li>
        <li>salt to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Soak potato strips in a large bowl of water for about 30 minutes. Pat with paper towels until thoroughly
            dry.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 275 degrees F (135 degrees C). Gently add potatoes to the hot
            oil and fry for about 5 minutes, stirring and flipping the potatoes occasionally. Use a slotted spoon to
            transfer potatoes to a paper towel-lined plate. Let cool completely.</li>
        <li>Heat oil again, but this time to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Add potatoes and fry a second time until
            golden brown, 5 to 6 minutes. </li>
        <li>Remove from the deep-fryer and blot with a paper towel. Sprinkle with salt to serve.</li>
    </ol>
